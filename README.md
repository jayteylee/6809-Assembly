# 6809-Assembly

The objective of this project was to create various programs that executed different tasks in the 6809 assembly language.

The constaints of this project was mostly working in assembly and getting used to only a few registers as well as only global variables.

---

Problem 1a A program that counts from 0 - 9 at the top left of the screen.

Problem 1b Same as 1a expect that its fewer than 8 instructions in length.

Problem 2a A program that compute and print each of the first 7 Fibonacci numbers in the top left of the screen.

Part 2b Same as 2b expect that it prints the Fibonacci numbers one after each other instead of just in the top left of the screen.

Problem 3a A routine that, given a value in register D, will print the value in hexadecimal. The emulator screen does not use ASCII, character 1 is ‘A’, character 2 is ‘B’, and so on so a routine that given a character in register A, will print it to the screen was first written. With these routines, a short test program was written to print the value FDCB then a space then 1234. The top left of the screen should read “FDCB 1234” once you have completed this.

Problem 3b A program that prints a comma separated list of the first 25 Fibonacci numbers in hexadecimal.

The code can be run by going to the 6809 simulator @ http://6809.uk/ and copy pasting the code "Assembly language input" press "Assemble source code" and then "Run" and then scrolling down to the "Text screen" to watch the magic unfold.
